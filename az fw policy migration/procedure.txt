MIGRATING GROUPS AND OBJECTS 

First part is to migrate all the groups and objects. Everything for this part is placed in "groups and objects" folder.
You MUST have 2 files: commands_output.txt and income_rules.txt literally the same name either the code won't work. 
Otherwise change it in the code (lines 9 and 10).

In the "income_rules.txt" file you can put group name in one line and then IP one by one, row by row (check this file).
Group must contain less then 101 characters or it must be changed in the code (line 22).

Be aware to put one empty line after the last IP in the group (like in income_rules.txt file). The code is searching
the last line and it won't work if you forget about it.

As well, be aware that you can delete characters for the Group ":" and the IPs "  - " in the code: lines 22 (group), 
30 and 44 (for IPs). I had the same yaml file as put: "example.yml" so I created the code like this.
