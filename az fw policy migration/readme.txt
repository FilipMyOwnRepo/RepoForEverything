Azure firewall policy migration to FortiGate

This procedure was created to migrate Azure firewall policy to FortiGate policy. The goal was to create
the commands that will be put on FortiGate firewall. If you have FMG (FortiManager), after implementing
all the rules to FortiGate, you can import the policy to FMG easily afterwards.

The procedure for this migration is in the procedure.txt file.
