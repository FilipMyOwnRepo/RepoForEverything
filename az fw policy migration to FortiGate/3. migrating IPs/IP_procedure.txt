Until this step, you should have the file with all the IPs listed row by row. That file is "source.txt".
You can paste all the IPs in this file. 

Next step is just to debug the program "migrating source IPs.cpp" and you will have all the commands in 
"source_commands.txt".

If you want to re-debug program and create new commands, first delete everything from "source_commands.txt"
file.

Be aware that this program does not check the ranges. You can check the program and add the ranges needed
or add it manually to the FortiGate.
